# Titanic - data science project 

## INTRODUCTION

The objective of this project is to predict whether a given person would survive from the Titanic crash.


### TASK1 - organizational instructions
All the 9 tasks given were addressed and added the files to their respective branch.

### TASK2 - sense of humour
A text file with a scenario is added.

### TASK3 - good practices
Followed and implemented the code with some good practices.

### TASK4 - feature engineering
## Data Handling and Feature Engineering;
  - Importing Data with Pandas
  - Data cleanzing and Data wrangling
  - Feature Importance with visualization

### TASK5 - models
## Data Analysis;
  - Scikit-learn 
  - Model selection and 
  - Hyperparameter Tuning
  
     # Implemented two types of methods to predict the accuracy rate.
          1. Model using Grid Search method
          2. Model without Grid Search method

Attached both the methods as seperate .py files.

### TASK6 - measures
A text file is attached to the respective branch which explains the best model for this particular data set and the comparison of other machine learning models.

### TASK7 - docker
A Dockerfile is created and added to the branch.

docker build-t<name>.-fcodeDockerfile to build Docker image.
 
Added complete code and Dockerfile of both the methods. 
 
### TASK8 - tests
Written a unit test code.

P.S. Apologise, due to time constraints, i couldnt complete and obtain the output.

### TASK9 - prediction api
As there were 2 methods implemented, I have used only one method to integrate with API.
  # Framework used:
    - Flask
